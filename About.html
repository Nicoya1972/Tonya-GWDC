        <h3>Marisa Castillo</h3>
        <h3>Founder</h3>
      <div id="demo3" class="collapse">
          <p>Marisa Castillo loves to dance and has been dancing for as long as she can remember. In the mid-1980’s, she quickly found her focus on ballet, but secretly wished that she could pop, lock and break. She trained in classical ballet and learned the details and finesse of classical Vaganova technique with Karen Morell. Augusta Moore introduced Marisa to Feldenkrais and her unique approach to ballet which was life changing. Marisa has danced with Peninsula Ballet Theatre, Santa Clara Ballet, and Columbia City Ballet. She furthered her dancing in the Certificate Program at the Ailey School in New York. She currently teaches ballet at ODC Dance Commons in San Francisco,  has taught at Stanford University, and is on the adjunct faculty at the University of San Francisco teaching Ballet.</p></a>
