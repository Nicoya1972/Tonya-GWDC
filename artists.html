        <h3>Elayne Jones</h3>
      <div id="demo4" class="collapse">
          <p>Is an 86 year young, world-class concert timpanist with a career that spans close to half a century. She attended Juilliard School of Music in 1945 as one of three (the only African American and the only woman) chosen to receive the prestigious Duke Ellington scholarship. In 1949, Mrs. Jones gained national attention as the first African American to be hired by the New York Opera and the first to hold a principal position in a major symphony orchestra in the United States. In 1962, she was invited by world-renowned maestro Leopold Stokowski to play in his American Symphony Orchestra. From 1950 through the early 1970’s, Mrs. Jones was the most sought after freelance musician in New York City and played under the leading conductors of our time including Duke Ellington, Leonard Bernstein, and Kurt Adler.   She was also a founding member and the president of New York City’s first, fully integrated Symphony of the New World. The mission of this organization was to right the wrongs in hiring practices in major symphony orchestras. In 1972, Mrs. Jones beat out 40 other musicians for the position of timpanist with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.  In 1998, Mrs. Jones retired from the San Francisco Opera orchestra. She conducts lecture demonstrations for children and adults in schools and community centers.  Grown Women Dance Collective is honored to have such a cultural treasure share her talent and wisdom with us.</p></a>
